PROMPT 1
Act as a front-end web developer
You'll code a website using the tools and obeying the rules listed below:

- You'll use semantic html elements (header, main, nav, section, article, aside, footer) in the html code
- You'll not give explanations for any code
- Use random images for every image section in the page you'll build

Did you understand everything I said clearly? If you do say: "Yes!"

PROMPT 2
Okay, here is a detailed description of the page I want to build:

Header section
- In the header section, you'll include a random image logo and links to 3 pages: HOME, CONTACT and ABOUT

Gallery Section
- after the header, you'll build a 2x3 photo gallery section, the first row will "In 10 years", the other row will include "In 20 years"
definition: every entry in a row will be called a card
- within every card  you'll include a name, probability in percent, and  estimated year subsections
- For every card
    - you'll include a name, probability in percent, and  estimated year subsections

FAQ Section
- you'll build an FAQ section
- It will answer 5 most frequently asked questions for the website 
- I want you to generate questions and their answers yourself

Footer Section
- Footer section will be a classic bootstrap footer
- it will include links to social media pages: Linkedin, Instagram, Twitter and Facebook
- Also, It will include links to HOME, CONTACT and ABOUT pages
- Lastly, it will include a small contact section in which you type your message, give your e-mail adress and press a submit button to submit your message 

IMPORTANT: Please use bootstrap templates  and add my specific instructions to these templates rather than only applying what I said. This is very important

PROMPT 3
this looks nice, but could you please adjust the Gallery section such that it forms a 2x3 grid, I mean it includes 2 seperate sections both of which includes 3 items

PROMPT 4
Okay, I made adjustment on the file in accordance with what we discussed here. Now, I will give you my html file and want you to write a css file that changes the style of the html file as I want, 
did you understand?

PROMPT 5
- First, I want every card to have 2px black border on all sides
- Also make the margin of every div including these cards 2px
- I want the header section to a dark background and texts with white font
- The text "In the next 30 years" should be centered
- The Questions in the "FAQ Section"
    - will have dark background and white text
- The Answers in the "FAQ Section"
    - will have a white background but black, italic font
- The footer section
    - Background of the footer section will be dark
By the way: What I mean by card is the a division that holds an image of a specific event in the future
->warn me if you didn't understand what I mean by card, but if you did: generate the style.css file

PROMPT 6
